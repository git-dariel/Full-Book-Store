            Vintage Books is a fictional project I made to improve my skills.
            Vintage Books is a local book-shop with the very best vintage
            collection. As a bookshop with many collectible books they wanted to
            feel and look true to their nature. <br></br> <br></br>When working
            on Vintage Books. I went with an antique vibe, a slight touch of
            modern and a vintage-aesthetic color combination.
